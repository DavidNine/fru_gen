# fru_gen

This is a simple tool written in Rust that generates a FRU (Field Replaceable Unit) file compatible with `ipmitool`. The tool automatically builds the Common Header, Chassis Info Area, Board Info Area, and Product Info Area of the FRU file, ensuring each areaâ€™s checksum is correctly calculated.
